**GreenHouse** is an Arduino project built using Arduino board and a Green house as a body<br />
The GreenHouse is made to protect and give the needed information for planting,<br />
It has a temperature and light sensor which display their data on the LTD Screen,<br />
If the temperature rises above 25 degrees a red light will be tunred with waring messgae on the screen,<br />
If the light is turned off below a certain level, a green light will be turned on for protection necessaries,<br />
